# Module 1 Challenge: An Analysis of KickStarter Campaigns- Michael Berg
Conclusion 1: Plays tend to be highly successful KickStarter campaigns, as overall they have a 67% success rate, versus ~54% for the broader KickStarter campaign (excludes live projects). In particular, the smaller KickStarter campaigns tend to be more successful within plays, and then gradually tail off as as the goals get larger, beginning with 76% for <$1000 goals and as low as 0% for $45,000 to $49,999. However, from $30,000 to $44,999, plays saw an uptick in success, before dropping off a cliff from 45,000 and above. Failures were the exact inverese of successes (of completed campaigns) as there are no current live campaigns. The exhibit below highlights the trend of success and failures by funding goal. ![Goal Based Outcomes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelberg1005/Module-1-Challenge/master/Michael%20Berg%20Module%201%20-%20Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Goals%20Line%20Chart.png). Overall, if someone wants to raise through Kickstarter for a play, esepcially with a small goal, it should have a high probability of success, and higher than broader campaigns.

Conclusion 2: Theatre based KickStarter campaigns gradually grow in volume in the first half of the year, peaking in May (as well as the number of successes), and then gradually tails off over the rest of the calendar year. However, there is no robust correlation between the probability of success and the month of launch. The range of success rate varies from 49% in December to 67% in May, with every month outside of December being in the 57%-67% range, and December being the lone outlier. While the month may matter some, having the best chance of success between April and June (63%, 67% and 63% respectively), and February tied as well, the difference, is not significant to draw material conclusion on when to start, but I may suggest between April and June. The number of successes, failures and cancelled theatre projects by month is highlighted in the exhibit below. ![Launch Date Outcomes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelberg1005/Module-1-Challenge/master/Michael%20Berg%20Module%201%20-%20Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Launch%20Date%20Line%20Chart.png) Overall, there is no strong conclusion to make about the timing of when to start a theatre based KickStarter campaign.

Conclusion 3: Looking at the entirety of the theatre parent category, plays had a signifcantly higher success rate than both the broader parent category, as well as the other subcategories within theatre. In particular, plays had a 67% success rate, while broader theatre had 61% success, which was dragged down by the subcategories of spaces and musicals having success rates of 47% and 43%, respectively. The exhibit below demonstrates the relative success rates of the parent and sub categories. ![Theatre Parent and Sub Category Likelihood of Success](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelberg1005/Module-1-Challenge/master/Michael%20Berg%20Module%201%20-%20Theatre%20Success%20Rates.PNG)Overall, play is the highest likelihood of success subcategory within the theatre parent category, suggesting type of campaign matters as well.

**Limitations of the dataset**: There are three key limitations of the dataset I think are critical to point out. 
1. There is no data that lets us know if the campaigns that were successful and raised their desired goals, were then able to purchase or successfully obtain the stated goals in the blurb, or did they have to go back and raise more money. Simply because a campaign raised its goals, does not mean it was able to achieve its stated mission in totality. 
2. While there is a fair amount of data (over 1000 data points in our focus area), it only goes from 2014 to 2017. If we wanted to understand the relationships within the data for either more recent data (2018-2020) or older data (prior to 2014) to get an updated and/or more holistic sample size, this data set can not provide that. Accordingly, the sample size, especially the years of available data, is a limitation of the data set.
3. There is also no item of data to show people who came back to raise money for the same idea/reason, but had failed previously, and had come close to their initial goal. If people initially failed (for numerous reasons, but mainly tried to raise too much), but then came back and succeeded, it could potentially skew the data to suggest the success rate is not as high as it truly is. Similarly, if people came back and failed multiple times, it could also skew the data negatively, as those project should be viewed as singular failures. Accordingly, the lack of repeat campaigns, whether success or failure, is a limitation of the data set.
---
**Suggestions for additional tables or graphs:** There are a few key tables and graphs that could be useful to analyze the data within our filtered field:
1. A line graph demonstrating success, failures and cancellations by the amount of time allotted for a campaign (deadline minus launced at date). This table would show if there is a correlation or suggestion of how long a campaign should be open for.
2. A similar pivot table, but showing the campign size groupings for success, failures and cancellations. This way you could see how long a campaign should be open to optimzie success by size.
3. Like my table in conclusion 3, a graph that shows the success rates of a parent category, and subcategories within it, to highlight what the highest likelihoods of success are, and what drags a parent category success up or down.
4. A pivot table highlighting the successes, failures and cancellations by the number of backer, and further filtering it by the campaign goal, to see how many backers it typically takes to have a successful campaign for various goal levels. A similar line graph could be done by dividing the amount raised by number of backers, to get the average donation per backer. The doing a line graph to show success, failure and cancellations by making groups of ranges of average bakcer donation.
