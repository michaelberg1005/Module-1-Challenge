# Module 1 Challenge: An Analysis of KickStarter Campaigns- Michael Berg
Conclusion 1: Plays tend to be highly successful KickStarter campaigns, as overall they have a 66% success rate, versus ~54% for the broader KickStarter campaign (excludes live projects). In particular, the smaller KickStarter campaigns tend to be more successful within plays, and then gradually tail off as as the goals get larger, beginning with 76% for <$1000 goals. However, from $30,000 to $44,999, plays saw an uptick in success, before dropping off a cliff from 45,000 and above. Failures were the exact inverese of successes (of completed campaigns) as there are no current live campaigns. The exhibit below highlights the trend of success and failures by funding goal. ![Goal Based Outcomes](/https://github.com/michaelberg1005/Module-1-Challenge/blob/master/Michael%20Berg%20Module%201%20-%20Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Goals%20Line%20Chart.png). Overall, if someone wants to raise through Kickstarter for a play, esepcially with a small goal, it should have a high probability of success, and higher than broader campaigns.

Conclusion 2: Theatre based KickStarter campaigns gradually grow in volume in the first half of the year, peaking in May (as well as the number of successes), and then gradually tails off over the rest of the calendar year. However, there is no robust correlation between the probability of success and the month of launch. The range of success rate varies from 49% in December to 67% in May, with every month outside of December being in the 57%-67% range, and December being the lone outlier. We highlight the number of successes, failures and cancelled theatre projects by month in the exhibit below. ![Launch Date Outcomes](/https://github.com/michaelberg1005/Module-1-Challenge/blob/master/Michael%20Berg%20Module%201%20-%20Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Goals%20Line%20Chart.png).
